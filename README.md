<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About vAR
Even though rudimentary video assistant referees for soccer is already implemented in FIFA sanctioned soccer tournaments, the cost of installation for goal-line technology, a small subset of the video assistant referee ecosystem starts from [300,000 USD](https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/01/fifa-var-goal-line-technology-future-of-soccer/?guccounter=1). We are trying to legitimize soccer games around the world that can't themselves afford this technology.

In addition, a major complaint of the video assitant referee system is that it slows down the pace of the game. Instead of making immediate on field decisions, the referee will consult a TV monitor or another referee at a TV monitor to rewatch the moments of interest. However, vARsity will make these decisions instantaneous and a decision will be sent to the referee immediatetly through a phone or smart watch notification.
